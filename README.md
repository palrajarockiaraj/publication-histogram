## Setting up your DEV ENVIRONMENT

### Install prerequisites

The following softwares are essential to run this application.
- Node.js 6 or higher
- npm 3 or higher (which comes bundled with Node)
- Git

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

```
node --version && npm --version
```

If you need to upgrade or install Node, the easiest way is to use an installer for your platform. Download the .msi for Windows or .pkg for Mac from the [NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/).

The [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager is bundled with Node, although you might need to update it. Some Node versions ship with rather old versions of npm. You can update npm using this command:

```
npm install --global npm@latest
```

If you don't have Git, grab the installers from the [git website](https://git-scm.com/).

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
